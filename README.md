# Nyao

Nyao is a location-based social media platform for mobile apps that is focused on cats. 

The nature of the app forces the intended audience to assume the title of "cat people". There is an existing reputation among cat people who are actively trying to incorporate cats into their lifestyle in many ways. For example, many cat people make Instagram accounts soley for their cats, follow social media accounts dedicated towards cats, and/or watch many cat videos online. This app will provide another platform for cat people to show their support and enthusiasm for cats through providing the ability to discover cat people nearby and learn more about other cats in their vicinity.
